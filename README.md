M.S. Genetics student at UNH: Spearheading an effort to characterize the USDA-GRIN collection of Tartary buckwheat. 
I am attempting to phenotypically characterize the collection, link those phenotypes to high quality genetic sequence data, and prepare the crop for breeding. My focus is on bioinformatics.
